  <h1>About Whyyoushould</h1>
  
  <p class="about-intro">
    <strong>Whyyoushould exists because your time is valuable.</strong> Too many reviews waste it. Padding word counts. Spoiling surprises. Refusing to make a judgment. We don't.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every review here answers one question: <em>Why should I spend my time on this?</em> Not "is it good?" (easy). Not "what happens?" (spoilery). But why your specific, finite hours matter with this choice instead of another.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Review</h2>
  
  <p>
    We play games fully. We watch films completely. We sit with experiences long enough to understand what they're actually arguing for. Then we tell you the truth—no hedging, no equivocating, no "it depends."
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes the truth is "this is essential." Sometimes it's "worth your weekend." Sometimes it's "honestly, skip it." All are useful. All are honest.
  </p>

  <h2>The Verdict System</h2>

  <div class="verdict-system">
    <div class="verdict-system-item">
      <div class="verdict-system-item-badge must">MUST</div>
      <div class="verdict-system-item-content">
        <h4>Must Play / Must Watch</h4>
        <p>This is essential. This is why the medium exists. Stop reading and go experience it. Clear recommendation with no caveats.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="verdict-system-item">
      <div class="verdict-system-item-badge worth">WORTH</div>
      <div class="verdict-system-item-content">
        <h4>Worth Your Time</h4>
        <p>This is genuinely good. Worthwhile if it aligns with your taste, interests, and current mood. A solid recommendation with context.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="verdict-system-item">
      <div class="verdict-system-item-badge skip">SKIP</div>
      <div class="verdict-system-item-content">
        <h4>Skip It</h4>
        <p>Not recommended. There are better uses of your time. We're not cruel about it—we explain why—but the verdict is clear.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

  <h2>About the Brand</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>WYS</strong> is the logo. Bold. Confident. Unapologetic. <strong>Whyyoushould</strong> is our full name, used in headers and footers. Together they represent a simple promise: we respect you enough to be honest.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our voice is conversational but decisive. You won't find filler here. No plot summaries masquerading as analysis. No "on one hand, on the other hand." Just clear thinking about what makes experiences worth your time.
  </p>

  <p>
    And crucially: <strong>no ads. No trackers. No newsletters you didn't ask for.</strong> This site exists to recommend things. That's it.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Cover</h2>

  <p>
    Movies (streaming and theatrical), games (all platforms), and eventually limited series, books, and experiences. Always the question: "Why should you spend your time on this?"
