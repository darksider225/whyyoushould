Baldur's Gate 3 understands that role-playing isn't about stats. It's about waking up in a crashed ship, deciding to help a mind flayer, and immediately questioning your own morality. Every conversation is a negotiation. Every combat encounter is a puzzle with multiple solutions. Sneak past? Charm them? Murder everyone? Seduce the boss? All viable.

The technical achievement is staggering. Larian built a system that genuinely tracks the web of your decisions. A choice you made 40 hours ago determines whether an NPC helps or executes you. The game doesn't fake player agency—it rewards, punishes, and surprises you based on who you actually are in this world.

150 hours later, you still haven't finished. And you don't want to. The story respects your intelligence. The writing is genuine—sometimes funny, sometimes devastating, never condescending. The companions have depth that rivals any narrative-focused game. Astarion, Gale, Shadowheart, Lae'zel—they breathe.

This is Dungeons & Dragons translated not faithfully, but perfectly. Larian Studios has raised a bar so high, the industry will be years reaching it. If you have any love for games, this is mandatory.
