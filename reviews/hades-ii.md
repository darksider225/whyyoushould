Hades II shouldn't work as well as it does. Sequels to beloved roguelikes face an impossible task: innovation without losing what made the original special. Supergiant solves this by shifting perspective entirely. You're not trying to escape the underworld. You're ascending from it, pursuing Chronos across a cosmos that keeps expanding.

Melinoë is a more compelling protagonist than Zagreus, not because she's better written (both are excellent) but because her motivation is proactive. She's hunting. That changes the entire energy of the game. New weapon types, new abilities, new layers of strategic depth—but the heart remains: each run is both a failure and a lesson.

The roguelike loop is where Supergiant excels. The grind doesn't feel like grind because narrative progression is woven through it. Relationships deepen. Characters reveal themselves. The world expands. Death stops being punishment and becomes narrative fuel. Every NPC interaction changes depending on your progress, your choices, your weapons.

Visually, it's Supergiant at their peak. The art direction is distinctive enough to feel instantly recognizable. Darren Korb's soundtrack is intoxicating. The pacing of runs (15-30 minutes) respects your time while remaining compelling enough that you'll lose track of it.

This is proof that roguelikes can have narrative depth without sacrificing mechanical integrity. Not mandatory like Elden Ring, but absolutely worthwhile if the genre appeals to you.
