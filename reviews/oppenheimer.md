Christopher Nolan doesn't make simple films, and Oppenheimer is deliberately labyrinthine. It's a three-hour investigation into a man's interior collapse framed as a historical epic. The structure—jumping between past, present, interrogation, and confirmation—requires active viewing. Your attention is not optional.

Cillian Murphy delivers what might be his finest performance. Oppenheimer's genius is almost incidental to the film's actual obsession: the way conscience eats itself. He created a weapon that worked exactly as designed, and that's precisely the problem. He knew what he was building. The moral reckoning isn't sudden; it's inevitable.

Robert Downey Jr. is chilling as Lewis Strauss, delivering a masterclass in performance-as-ideology. The supporting cast contains universes. But the film's real power is Nolan's refusal to simplify. This isn't about a brilliant man facing consequences. It's about how being brilliant doesn't exempt you from paradox. How knowing better doesn't guarantee you'll do better.

The cinematography is expansive. The sound mixing is aggressive (bring subtitles). The score pushes you toward anxiety. This is cinema designed to activate your brain, not soothe it.

If you have the patience for slow-burn narrative density and three hours, this justifies the time. Don't expect easy answers. Expect a question that won't leave you.
