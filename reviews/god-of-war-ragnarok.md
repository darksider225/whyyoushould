God of War Ragnarök proves that blockbuster games can be emotionally sophisticated. This isn't a dad protecting his son anymore—it's two people discovering they fundamentally disagree about what matters, and neither can back down. Kratos is a man trying to change his nature; Atreus is a teenager learning who he actually is.

The writing is genuinely excellent. The dialogue crackles because the stakes are personal. Christopher Judge's voice work as Kratos contains universes of regret and stubborn hope. Sunny Suljic gives Atreus a volatile, genuine teenage perspective—he's infuriating in ways that feel earned, not written.

Combat remains the series' strongest element—visceral, weighty, with genuine tactical depth. But the game smartly makes room for quieter moments. Traversal becomes meditation. Conversations in travel reveal character. The Norse mythology is deployed with real depth, respecting source material while inventing its own mythology.

The ending won't please everyone—it's morally complicated, refusing easy closure. That's the point. Ragnarök isn't a reset; it's transformation. Consequences stick.

This is a sequel that justifies its existence. Not just a bigger version of 2018, but a genuine evolution. Emotionally, creatively, narratively. Required playing.
