Madame Web exists in a confusing state between film and committee decision. Dakota Johnson looks perpetually uncertain about whether she's in a serious drama or a comic book movie. The answer is: neither. She's in a franchise mandate disguised as a narrative.

The plot refuses coherence in ways that seem almost willful. Time travel mechanics are introduced and abandoned. Character motivations evaporate between scenes. A protagonist makes a choice that contradicts her established character because the script needed that choice to happen. Relationships form without context. Villains appear because a quota needed filling.

The action sequences lack punch. The dialogue sounds like characters reading exposition at each other. The supporting cast—including Oscar Isaac in an embarrassing cameo that costs millions—seem to have filmed their scenes in isolation with no understanding of what the surrounding film was trying to accomplish.

What's remarkable is the waste. There's actual talent here (Johnson, Isaac, Mike Epps, Dan Rivera) being asked to execute a script that doesn't trust its audience, doesn't know its own mythology, and mistakes references for narrative. Superhero fatigue isn't about quantity. It's about this.

Your time is genuinely valuable. Sony wants you to spend it on this so you'll stay invested in a universe nobody asked for. Don't. Watch Dune: Part Two again instead.
